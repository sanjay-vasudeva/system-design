# Patterns and Techniques for Writing High-Performance Applications with Go

The **Go App Optimization Guide** is a collection of technical articles aimed at helping developers write faster, more efficient Go applications. Whether you're building high-throughput APIs, microservices, or distributed systems, this series offers practical patterns, real-world use cases, and low-level performance insights to guide your optimization efforts.

While Go doesn’t expose as many knobs for performance tuning as languages like C++ or Rust, it still provides **plenty of opportunities** to make your applications significantly faster. From memory reuse and allocation control to efficient networking and concurrency patterns, Go offers a pragmatic set of tools for writing high-performance code.

We focus on **concrete techniques** with **measurable impact** you can apply immediately—covering everything from core language features to advanced networking strategies.

### [Common Go Patterns for Performance](./01-common-patterns/index.md)

In this first article, we explore a curated set of high-impact performance patterns every Go developer should know:

- Using `sync.Pool` effectively
- Avoiding unnecessary allocations
- Struct layout and memory alignment
- Efficient error handling
- Zero-cost abstractions with interfaces
- In-place sorting and slices reuse

Each pattern is grounded in practical use cases, with benchmarks and examples you can copy into your own codebase.

### High-Performance Networking in Go

In our upcoming deep dive into networking, we'll focus on building high-throughput network services with Go’s standard library and beyond. This includes:

- Efficient use of `net/http` and `net.Conn`
- Managing large volumes of concurrent connections
- Performance tuning with epoll/kqueue and `GOMAXPROCS`
- Load testing techniques and bottleneck diagnostics
- TBD...

We'll also explore when to drop down to lower-level libraries like `fasthttp`, and how to balance performance with maintainability.
